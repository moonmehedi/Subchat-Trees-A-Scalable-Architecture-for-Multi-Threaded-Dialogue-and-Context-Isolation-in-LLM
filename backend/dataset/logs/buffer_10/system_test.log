[15:12:24] [INFO]   🤖 AI Response:
[15:12:24] [INFO]      odd_count: To solve the odd_count problem, we need to write a function that takes a list of strings as input, where each string represents a number. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of odd digits in the corresponding input string. For the input ['1234567'], the function should return [4], because there are 4 odd digits (1, 3, 5, and 7) in the string '1234567'.
