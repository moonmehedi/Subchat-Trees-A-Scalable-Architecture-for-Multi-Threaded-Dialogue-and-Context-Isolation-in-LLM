The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of odd digits in the corresponding input string. For the input ['1234567'], the function should return [4], because there are 4 odd digits (1, 3, 5, and 7) in the string '1234567'.

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each letter.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1.
4. If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
