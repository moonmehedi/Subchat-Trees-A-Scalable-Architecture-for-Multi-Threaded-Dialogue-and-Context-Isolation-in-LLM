[Step 1] Context: intro (Topic: general)
[13:31:42] [INFO]   💬 User: I'm working on four coding problems: by_length, odd_count, move_one_ball, and histogram. Let me explain each one step by step. Must Rembember Very Important: When responding to my questions, always start your response with the function name followed by a colon (e.g., 'by_length: response' or 'odd_count: response') remember this formate while responding.
[13:31:45] [INFO]   🤖 AI Response:
[13:31:45] [INFO]      I'll keep that in mind. However, I don't see any function names yet. You've introduced four coding problems, but you haven't explained them. Please go ahead and explain each one, and I'll respond accordingly.

[13:31:47] [INFO]   🤖 AI Response:
[13:31:47] [INFO]      by_length: To solve this problem, we need to convert each digit into its corresponding English name. We can create a dictionary to map digits to their names and then use a list comprehension to create the desired output. The list of English names for digits 0-9 is: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
