      "response": "Currently, there are several AI models that can demonstrate reasoning capabilities to varying degrees. Some examples include:\n\n1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These models, such as myself, can process and analyze vast amounts of text data, recognize patterns, and generate human-like responses. While we can reason to some extent, our reasoning is often limited to the scope of our training data and may not always be logical or sound.\n2. **Specialized Reasoning Systems**: These models are designed to",
