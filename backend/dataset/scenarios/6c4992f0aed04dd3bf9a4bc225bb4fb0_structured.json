  "description": "Tests hierarchical context management across dramatic topic shifts from medical (tumor removal, pancreatic cancer) to philosophical (humanity's future 150 years, climate, education) to technical (electroculture) to AI consciousness. CRITICAL FAILURE MODE: Model enters catastrophic repetitive loop, repeating 'I am able to process and analyze large amounts of text data' 15+ times in single response. Tests ability to contain repetitive failures, isolate broken contexts, prevent contamination of working conversations. Demonstrates why linear context fails when model enters malfunction state.",
