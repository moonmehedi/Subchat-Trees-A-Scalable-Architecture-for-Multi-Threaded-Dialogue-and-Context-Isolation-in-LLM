  "description": "HIGHEST VALUE TEST CASE for hierarchical vs linear context management. User explicitly requests 'Clear context. New question thread will start' and multiple 'New thread' markers throughout 74-turn conversation. Tests deliberate context separation across diverse domains: historical facts, logic puzzles, LSAT reasoning, Indian legal code, child nutrition, astrology, elections, travel, food, therapy, and chess. Critical feature: Model acknowledges resets with 'Got it! Starting a new thread...' but maintains full context - perfect test for hierarchical isolation benefits.",
