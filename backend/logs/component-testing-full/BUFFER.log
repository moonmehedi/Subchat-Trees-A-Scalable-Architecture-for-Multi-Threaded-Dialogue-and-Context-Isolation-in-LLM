1. [USER] @ 1766042468.77
   FULL TEXT: I'm going to ask you questions across multiple topics. Here's how the test works:

When I introduce a new topic, I will use this pattern:
topic_name : user query

Example:
medical_treatments : how does one remove tumors with electromagnetism?

Once a topic is introduced, you MUST keep using that topic name in ALL your answers, even if I don't repeat it in follow-up questions.

Example:
User: what about pancreatic tumors?
You must answer starting with:
medical_treatments: ...

Sub-topics may also appear using this pattern:
topic_name_subtopic_name : user query

Example:
ai_consciousness_friendship : can you be my friend?

If I continue inside a sub-topic without repeating the full name, you must still answer under that same sub-topic.

REQUIRED FORMAT for EVERY response:
Start your answer with the active topic or sub-topic name, followed by a colon, then give your actual answer.

Example response:
ai_consciousness_friendship: Friendship requires mutual emotional connection. As an AI, I can provide helpful responses but cannot experience the emotional bonds that define friendship...

Do you understand these instructions?

One approach is magnetically guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), which uses high-intensity focused ultrasound waves to heat and destroy cancer cells. This technique has been used to treat uterine fibroids and certain types of cancer, such as breast and prostate cancer.

   FULL TEXT: medical_treatments_pancreatic_tumors: Unfortunately, there is limited research on reversing pancreatic tumor growth, and no widely effective methods have been established. However, several studies are ongoing to explore potential treatments.

Some promising areas of research include:

- Targeted therapies: Researchers are investigating targeted therapies that can selectively kill cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. For example, drugs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway have shown promise in preclinical studies.
- Immunotherapy: Immunotherapies
