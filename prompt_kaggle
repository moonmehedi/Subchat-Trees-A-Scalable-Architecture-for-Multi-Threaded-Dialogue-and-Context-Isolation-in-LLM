you can follow below steps then push on github from the kaggle environment do till this

lets first veryfy git push is possible


2) Push logs back to GitHub from Kaggle
Important prerequisites

Kaggle Notebook Settings → Internet ON

You need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Safer: Fine-grained token with access only to that repo.

A) Clone your repo
!git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
%cd YOUR_REPO

B) Run tests and save logs inside the repo folder
!mkdir -p logs
!python -u run_tests.py 2>&1 | tee -a logs/test.log

C) Commit logs and push

Set your git identity:

!git config user.name "moonmehedi"
!git config user.email "the.mehedi.hasan.moon@gmail.com"


Add + commit:

!git add logs/test.log
!git commit -m "Add test logs from Kaggle run"


Push using token (without printing it):
In Kaggle, store the token as an environment variable (best practice):

import os
os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"] = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"


Then push:

!git remote set-url origin https://$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
!git push origin main


⚠️ Do not make the notebook public if it contains the token.
Also avoid printing os.environ["GITHUB_TOKEN"].
