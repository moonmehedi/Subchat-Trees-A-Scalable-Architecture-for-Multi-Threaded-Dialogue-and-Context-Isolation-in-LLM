This can be achieved through a technique known as magnetic hyperthermia, where magnetic nanoparticles are introduced into the tumor. When exposed to an alternating magnetic field, these nanoparticles generate heat, which can destroy the cancer cells without significantly affecting the surrounding healthy tissue.\n",
